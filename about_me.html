                    <p> Hi everyone! I am an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University 
                        studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and planning to double 
                        major in Computer Science. </p>
                    <p> My main areas of interest are Machine Learning (especially Deep Learning) 
                        and Software Engineering. I am always looking to build my skill set via 
                        internship/research opportunities in related fields. </p>
                    <p>  Apart from academics and work, I am a fitness enthusiast and love to lift 
                        weights and go for long runs. I also enjoy playing the guitar and listening 
                        to music. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to learn more about 
                        me or just want to chat! </p>
