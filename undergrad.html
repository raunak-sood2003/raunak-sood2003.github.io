                    <ul>
                        <li> One of my favorite classes at CMU. I love data structures and algorithms 
                             and this class had exactly what I was looking for. It builds on the data 
                             structures from 122 but also has significantly more emphasis on algorithm design. 
                             I just found the theory and proofs remarkable; enough said! 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This class uses SML (functional programming language) from 150, so make sure 
                            to brush up on that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Warning: this class has notoriously difficult homework and exams; for many of the 
                            programming assignments, you will need to use OH extensively, so don't be afraid to go. 
                            Also, if you do poorly on an exam, don't be hard on yourself: almost everyone else is in 
                            the same boat. The best way to prepare for the exams is to go back to problems and algorithms 
                            you have seen in the lectures/notes/homework and think about how to slightly modify them to 
                            solve a different problem.

                            One of the best classes at CMU. The lectures covered mind-blowing topics in theoretical CS; 
                            I don't think there was one day this semester where I wasn't in awe at how amazing CS is. 
                            The way the course was structured as well as the fantastic teaching was also a huge plus. 
                            Overall, a must take class!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Warning: this class has a very heavy course load and difficulty. Even if you are capable of handling 
                            a lot, it is worth dedicating a lot of time to this class; it will only help you appreciate the material even more!

                            I felt like this was one of the more important and underrated classes at CMU. This class builds upon an intro to 
                            probability class and covers methods of estimation and inference. I would strongly recommend taking this class if 
                            you want to pursue anything in data science/ML. Reading ML papers and research became so much easier after taking this class.

                            I'm not much of a hardware guy, but learning about basic circuit elements is important for all things ECE; it was pretty 
                            interesting learning about various circuit elements and how they work.

                            This was definitely one of the harder semesters I have had so far at CMU. Generally, I wouldn't recommend taking 210 and 251 
                            together because they are both so heavy. But, I really wanted to finish the CS cores sooner so I could take higher level classes sooner.

                        <li>
                            This class is split into three main parts: deliberate programming, data structures and C programming
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It can be pretty weird at first since you have to formally prove the correctness and safety of your code; however, 
                            this makes you much better at writing code correctly the first time and you make less errors in general.

                        <li>
                            My favorite part of this class was learning about various data structures and how they are implemented.

                            My first impression of this class was “Why do I need to know any of this?”. But, I realized that writing code in a 
                            functional way is much cleaner and more efficient, especially if you are interested in parallel programming.

                            This class really made me love being an ECE major. Signal processing is a fascinating field (backed by some really cool math) and has so 
                            many applications in machine learning, finance, medicine and much more.
                        </li>

                            I would recommend taking this class even if you aren't an ECE major because most technical disciplines deal with signals in some shape or form.

                            Many people (including advisors) will tell you not to take 122 and 150 together because both classes are very programming intensive. 
                            In my opinion, I found it very insightful taking them together because they show you how to approach similar problems in two very 
                            different ways. For example, both classes cover BSTs, but the approach to BST implementation and algorithms were so different in the two classes.

                            This class was a fast paced introduction to ECE. I found it difficult in the beginning because I had no exposure to circuits, 
                            but the TAs and Profs understand this and are really helpful.

                            and abstract math topics (like me), it can be pretty challenging initially.
