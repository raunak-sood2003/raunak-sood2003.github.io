                  <p> <i>July 2023 - August 2023</i> </p>
                  <p> Continued teaching the discrete math primer we piloted last year. I held weekly review sessions and 
                    worked through problem sets to solidy their understanding of the material. </p>

                <h2>Software Engineering Intern, Optum</h2>
                <p> <i>June 2023 - August 2023</i></p>
                <p> Worked with the network integration team to speed up the process of connecting employees 
                    under acquired companies to the internal Optum network securely. Worked on an 
                    interface that automatically populates rack diagrams from integration documents. Utilized 
                    Python socket programming to set up file transfer and remote command line execution 
                    between servers and clients. </p>

                <p> <i>August 2022 - Present</i> </p>
                <p> I work closely with the professor and head TA to hold weekly review/practice sessions for 15-122 (Imperative Programming). 
                    I create practice problems sets and solutions and go through them with students to ensure their mastery of the material. </p>

                    <p> Piloted a discrete math primer for incoming CMU freshman. The purspose was to help students with little discrete math background 
                        be better prepared for math at CMU. The primer seemed to help students adjust to the difficulty of CMU as students performed much 
                        better compared to previous semesters. </p>

                  <h2> Data Engineering Intern, Optum </h2>
                  <p> <i>June 2022 - August 2022</i> </p>
                  <p>  Worked with time dependent flu ratio data and used exploratory data analysis techniques such as dynamic time warping to 
                    better understand the time series data. Used time series forecasting models such as ARIMA and SARIMA to predict flu ratios in 
                    metropolitan statistical areas six weeks ahead of time. We were able to train models up to 90% accuracy for over 180 locations.
                    Explored deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks and observed similar accuracies. </p>
